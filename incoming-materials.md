## A. Incoming Materials

All collection material should be received by the Accessioning and Collections Manager. The Accessioning and Collections Manager will retrieve the material from either the Rose Library mailroom on Level 10 or the main Woodruff Library mailroom on Level 2.

Acquisitions will be unpacked and matched broadly against the accompanying paperwork in terms of number and type of items. Items will be placed on the curators' purchase and gift shelves for review. Documentation will be uploaded to the appropriate folders on Box, and the curator will be notified of receipt on Box. The vendor will also be notified of receipt via email.

At this time, all materials will be added to the Rose Library Acquisitions Log, one based on the fiscal year for purchases and one based on the calendar year for gifts. These logs are maintained on Box and include the physical location of the materials, as well as the status of payment and/or documentation.

Curators or the Rare Book Cataloger, as appropriate, will review the materials and determine whether or not to move forward with the acquisition. If the curator decides to not move forward with the acquisition, it is the curator's responsibility to notify the donor/seller. The Accessioning and Collections Manager can help coordinate return of the material, once the donor/seller has been notified by the curator.

### Paperwork

No collection material may be cataloged until the appropriate paperwork has been completed, received and submitted by the Accessioning and Collections Manager. Any paperwork signed by the donor/seller, including Deeds of Sale, Deeds of Gift and Gift-in-Kind Contribution Forms, should be transferred in their original form to the Accessioning and Collections Manager to later be retained in the permanent collection file (CL-2 and CL-5 files). Copies are only acceptable in terms of the PRFs and invoices.

### Accessioning and cataloging verification

In terms of purchases, the Accessioning and Collections Manager considers the fact that paperwork has been submitted to ServiceNow to execute payment as a completed transaction, and, therefore, items may be accessioned or cataloged. In terms of gifts, the Accessioning and Collections Manager relies only on receipt of the Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form and the Deed of Gift, if required, in order to proceed with accessioning and/or cataloging. The Accessioning and Collections Manager is responsible for notifying the accessioning team and/or rare book cataloger when materials are ready for accessioning or cataloging, as well as physically moving collection material to appropriate and agreed upon holding locations. At no point should a curator or other individual other than the Accessioning and Collections Manager move new acquisitions from holding shelves to another location in the library.

## B. Recent acquisitions

When new acquisitions are paid for and ready to be cataloged, they will be moved to Recent Acquisition shelving, currently on range 12B. The Rare Book Cataloger will either catalog these items within regular workflow, or delegate items to other catalogers.
