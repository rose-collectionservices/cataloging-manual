# E. Call Numbers

Until 2010 MARBL materials were cataloged using the LC classification scheme.  Starting with 2010 1, Rose switched to a system which where call numbers begin with the Fiscal Year, (2017, etc.) followed by a sequential number. To avoid duplication of call numbers there is a shared spreadsheet on the F drive where catalogers record the number range they are using.

* Assign folio call numbers if the item measures 30 cm or more in height or are 25 cm or more wide.
* Assign folio numbers if the item is less than ½ inch wide and measures over 29 cm tall or 22 cm wide. These items will be placed in envelopes that are too tall to stand on the shelf and must be shelved with folios.

1.	Rose general collection monographs: 2017 1
2.	Rose general collection folios: FOLIO 2017 1
3.	General collection serials: SERIAL 2017 1
4.	General collection serial folios: SERIAL FOLIO 2014 1
5.	Danowski  monographs: DANOWSKI 2017 1
6.	Danowski folios: DANOWSKI FOLIO 2017 1
7.	Danowski serials: DANOWSKI SERIAL 2017 1
8.	Danowski serial folios (over 30 cm tall): DANOWSKI SERIAL FOLIO 2017 1
9.	For other named collections call numbers, always record the collection name first, followed by the format designation (folio, serial, etc.), followed by the fiscal year and sequential call number. This follows the construction of the Danowski call numbers above.
10.	Emory University Archives items are cataloged using their own set of sequential numbers. The numbers should be given the prefix EUA:
  a. EUA 2017 1
11.	Any particularly rare item, or item that has a high monetary value should be shelved in the vault. Vault items receive regular call numbers as appropriate, but the marking tag should read: VAULT 2017 42, etc. These items are usually marked by the cataloger, rather than waiting in the queue, and then shelved immediately in the vault.
12.	More than one copy of a volume may be kept for a variety of reasons, including an inscription or other special characteristic. If the new copy is part of a discrete collection, then give it a sequential call number that fits with the rest of that collection. If the new copy is not part of any particular collection do the following:

If the copy or copies already cataloged for Rose have an LC call number, add the new volume to the same call number, adding “copy 2” (etc.) to the item information in Alma.

If the new copy has a sequential call number, add the new volume to that same call number, adding “copy 2” (etc.) to the item information in Alma.
