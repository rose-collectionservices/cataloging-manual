# General Procedures

## C. Cataloging

1.	Cataloging priorities are determined collaboratively by the Rare Book Cataloger, Accessioning and Collections Manager, and the Head of Collection Services on a flexible multi-year plan.
2.	All materials published after 1801 for Rose Library are cataloged according to current RDA Guidelines and OCLC standards.
3.	Materials created before 1801 are cataloged according to the relevant sections of Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (DCRM), including the use of the Rare Book and Manuscript Section Controlled Vocabulary (RBMS vocabulary).
4.	Both copy and original cataloging is carried out in OCLC Connexion, and finished records are exported to Alma, where holdings and items are set. Please see the section on Alma for more detail.
5.	Catalogers apply Library of Congress Subject Headings, and headings from other thesauri as appropriate: Library of Congress Form/Genre Terms (lcgft), Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Thesaurus for Graphic Materials (TGM), etc.
